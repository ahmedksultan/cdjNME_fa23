CDJ NME FA23 #1 -- October 21st, 2023

Suggested order of notebooks:
1) [python.ipynb] provides a crash course in Python.
2) [datacollection.ipynb] provides a basic overview of NumPy, Pandas and seaborn	in the context of importing, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing a
	dataset. This is basically a very quick CDJ-style project!
3) [numpy.ipynb] goes more in depth on the NumPy package--teaching you more
	complex skills you may need for your actual CDj project.
4) [pandas.ipynb] goes more in depth on the pandas package--teaching you more
	complex skills you may need for your actual CDJ project.

After completing these notebooks, create a new notebook where you find a dataset online, import it, and essentially go through the motions from [datacollection.ipynb] to demonstrate mastery in these foundational skills.
